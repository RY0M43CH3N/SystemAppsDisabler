You can restore everything by:
Reinstalling your firmware, and then rebuilding the database.
To reinstall your firmware:
0. Download the (3.60 Update Pup)[https://nzxtrules.stackstorage.com/s/EjNBnT8myxlNnc1]
1. Connect your vita to your PC via QCMA
2. Copy the 3.60 Update.pup to your QCMA backups folder
3. Download (psp2-updatelist.xml)[https://pastebin.com/raw/tBLZNRi7] and put it into your QCMA backups folder as well
4. Edit it with notepad++ and change where it says (region id="insert_region_here") to your PSVITA's Region ID (check here if you dont know it.)[https://pastebin.com/raw/xGHbSiSW]
5. Change where it says (label="optionally_insert_firmware_version_here") to 3.60
6. Boot your PSVITA into SAFE MODE
7. Goto Update System Software > Via PC
8. Make sure it says "Version 3.60" and then press NEXT
9. Painfully scroll down to the bottom of the EULA.
